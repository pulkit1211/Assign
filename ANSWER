BACKEND ASSIGNMENT: “Ecommerce API with Node js”
Build an API set to support e-commerce operations, such as product and category listing, product
details, cart management, and order processing. Prefer firebase or any other suitable database to
manage product/category data, user cart information, and order details. The APi should also
handle token management in the system
Requirements:
1. API Endpoints:
a. Category Listing: Create an API endpoint that retrieves a list of categories.
b. Product Listing: Create an API endpoint that retrieves a list of products with
essential details such as title, price, description, and availability, based on
category Id
c. Product Details: Implement an endpoint that fetches the detailed information of a
specific product by its ID.
d. Cart Management: Develop API endpoints to allow users to add products to their
cart, view the cart, update quantities, and remove items from the cart.
e. Order Placement: Create an endpoint to handle order placement, allowing users
to place an order with products from their cart.
f. Order History: Implement an endpoint to fetch the order history for authenticated
users.
g. Order Details: Create an endpoint that retrieves the detailed information of a
specific order by its ID.

h. A set of API to register and login the users

NOTE: Ignore any payment related APIs for simplicity. We will assume that payment is not needed
for orders
2. Database Integration: Integrate MongoDB or MySql or any other DB schema to store and
manage product data, user cart information, and order details. The API should interact
with DB to perform CRUD operations on products, cart items, and orders.
3. Authentication Middleware and security: Implement authentication middleware to secure
sensitive API endpoints, such as cart management and order placement. Only
authenticated users should be allowed to access these endpoints.
4. User Authentication: Implement user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Users
should be able to register, log in, and obtain a token to authenticate API requests.
5. Error Handling: Ensure appropriate error handling is in place, and the API returns
meaningful error messages and status codes when necessary.
6. Documentation: Create documentation for the API endpoints, including details about their
functionality, expected input, and output. A swagger doc is preferred
7. Rate limiting (optional): Add API rate limiting to prevent abuse and maintain server
stability.

Please push the code on your github broken down into commits along with a read me file
showing a brief on how to set up the project, API integration details (for front end assignment
only), API doc (for backend assignment only). and any important design decisions you made
during development.

I can certainly help you get started with building the Ecommerce API using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. However, I can't directly push code to GitHub or create an actual repository. I'll provide you with the code and instructions here, and you can create your own repository on GitHub and push the code there.

Let's break down the implementation into steps:

Step 1: Setting Up the Project
Create a new project folder.
Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init.
Install the required packages using npm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken body-parser.
Step 2: Folder Structure
Your project structure might look something like this:

css
Copy code
ecommerce-api/
│   README.md
│   package.json
│   app.js
└───routes/
│   │   category.js
│   │   product.js
│   │   cart.js
│   │   order.js
└───models/
│   │   Category.js
│   │   Product.js
│   │   User.js
│   │   Order.js
└───controllers/
│   │   categoryController.js
│   │   productController.js
│   │   cartController.js
│   │   orderController.js
└───middlewares/
│   │   authentication.js
└───utils/
│   │   generateToken.js
Step 3: Implementing API Endpoints
I'll provide you with the code snippets for a few key endpoints. You can follow a similar pattern to implement the rest.

routes/category.js
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const categoryController = require('../controllers/categoryController');

router.get('/', categoryController.getAllCategories);

module.exports = router;
controllers/categoryController.js
javascript
Copy code
const Category = require('../models/Category');

exports.getAllCategories = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const categories = await Category.find();
    res.json(categories);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server Error' });
  }
};
You'll need to implement similar structures for other endpoints.

Step 4: Integrating MongoDB
Create your MongoDB database and configure the connection in app.js.

app.js
javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const app = express();

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/ecommerce_db', {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
mongoose.connection.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection error:'));

// ... other middleware and routes

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
Step 5: Implementing User Authentication and JWT
I'll provide code snippets for user authentication and JWT token generation.

models/User.js
javascript
Copy code
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: { type: String, required: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
});

module.exports = mongoose.model('User', userSchema);
controllers/authController.js
javascript
Copy code
const User = require('../models/User');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const { secretKey } = require('../config'); // Create a config file to store your secret key

exports.login = async (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;

  try {
    const user = await User.findOne({ username, password });
    if (!user) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });

    const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user._id }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });

    res.json({ token });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Server Error' });
  }
};
Step 6: Error Handling and Documentation
Implement proper error handling in your controllers and middleware. You can use Express's built-in error handling middleware.
